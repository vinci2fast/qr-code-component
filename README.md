## My process

Built by doing mobile first but realized that it was not necessary. A bit easier than the product preview card since repsonsive design is not the proirity.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I'll focus on more harder projects now since this made me realize that I somewhat know HTML and CSS. Maybe I'll start working on JavaScript projects now.
